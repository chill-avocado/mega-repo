# Functional Categorization of AI/AGI Repositories

This directory contains a functional categorization of the various repositories in the mega-repo. Each subdirectory represents a specific functional category and contains copies of the code files from the original repositories.

## Categories

1. **[Agent Frameworks](./agent_frameworks/)**: Repositories focused on creating autonomous AI agents
2. **[User Interfaces](./user_interfaces/)**: Repositories focused on UI/UX for AI systems
3. **[OS Interaction](./os_interaction/)**: Repositories for AI interaction with operating systems
4. **[Browser Automation](./browser_automation/)**: Repositories for AI-driven browser interaction
5. **[Code Execution](./code_execution/)**: Repositories for code generation and execution
6. **[Cognitive Systems](./cognitive_systems/)**: Repositories focused on cognitive architectures
7. **[Evolution & Optimization](./evolution_optimization/)**: Repositories for evolutionary algorithms
8. **[Integration](./integration/)**: Repositories that combine multiple systems
9. **[NLP](./nlp/)**: Repositories focused on natural language processing
10. **[Documentation](./documentation/)**: Repositories that are collections or documentation

## How to Use This Categorization

Each category directory contains:
- A README explaining the category and included repositories
- Copies of code files from the original repositories
- Common functionality extracted and organized by purpose

You can navigate to a specific category to find all related code across different repositories, making it easier to understand and work with functionally similar components.
