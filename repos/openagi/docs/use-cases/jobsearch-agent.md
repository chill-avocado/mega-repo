# üîç JobSearch Agent

It utilize various tools for internet search and document comparison to fulfill its task. Upon finding the relevant job opportunities, The script configures the agent's role, goal, backstory, capabilities, and specific task to accomplish. Additionally, it initializes logging for debugging purposes and triggers the execution of the agent.

**Import Required Libraries**

First, we need to import the necessary modules. Each module serves a specific purpose in our script. We utilize various tools for internet search and document comparison to fulfill the agent's task. Here‚Äôs what each import does:

* `GoogleSerpAPISearch` and `DuckDuckGoSearch` are tools for performing web searches.
* `Admin` manages the overall execution of tasks.
* `AzureChatOpenAIModel` is used to configure the large language model from Azure.
* `Memory` is for maintaining context during the agent's operations.
* `TaskPlanner` helps in decomposing tasks into manageable sub-tasks.
* `Worker` represents individual agents with specific roles and responsibilities.
* `Console` and `Markdown` from the `rich` library are used for printing formatted outputs.

```python
from openagi.actions.tools.serp_search import GoogleSerpAPISearch
from openagi.actions.tools.ddg_search import DuckDuckGoSearch
from openagi.agent import Admin
from openagi.llms.azure import AzureChatOpenAIModel
from openagi.memory import Memory
from openagi.planner.task_decomposer import TaskPlanner
from openagi.worker import Worker
from rich.console import Console
from rich.markdown import Markdown
import os
```

**Setup LLM**&#x20;

Next, we set up the environment variables and configure the Azure OpenAI model. This setup allows us to use Azure's GPT-4 model with the script. Setting up the environment variables ensures the necessary keys and endpoints are accessible during execution.

```python
os.environ["AZURE_BASE_URL"] = "https://<replace-with-your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/"
os.environ["AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"] = "<replace-with-your-deployment-name>"
os.environ["AZURE_MODEL_NAME"] = "gpt4-32k"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"] = "2023-05-15"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<replace-with-your-key>"

config = AzureChatOpenAIModel.load_from_env_config()
llm = AzureChatOpenAIModel(config=config)
```

**Define Workers**&#x20;

We define workers with specific roles and instructions. Each worker agent is equipped with the tools necessary to perform their designated tasks. The worker in this script is set up to search for job opportunities using DuckDuckGo.

```
websearcher = Worker(
    role="SW",
    instructions="""
    You are an Expert Python SW Developer with deep knowledge of job markets.

    - Consider various industries and company sizes
    - Pay attention to job descriptions, required skills, and company culture
    """,
    actions=[DuckDuckGoSearch],
)
```



**Define Admin**&#x20;

The `Admin` agent manages the workers and executes the tasks. It is configured to use the task planner without human intervention and maintains context using memory.

```python
admin = Admin(
    actions=[DuckDuckGoSearch],
    planner=TaskPlanner(human_intervene=False),
    memory=Memory(),
    llm=llm,
)
admin.assign_workers([websearcher])
```

**Execute Agent LLM**&#x20;

The admin runs with a specific query to find job opportunities. The query includes detailed instructions on what information to gather and how to present it.

```python
    res = admin.run(
        query="""
        Provide a list of at least 10 SDE2 job opportunities suitable for candidates with 2+ years of Python experience.
        For each job, include:
        1. Company name and location
        2. Job title
        3. Key responsibilities
        4. Required skills
        5. Any standout perks or benefits
        6. Application link or process (if available)
        """,

        - Organize the information in a clear, easy-to-read format
        - Highlight any unique or particularly attractive aspects of each role
        """,
    )
```

**Print the Results**

Finally, the results are outputted using the `rich` library, which allows us to print the data in a nicely formatted markdown.

```python
# Print the results from the OpenAGI
print("-" * 100)  # Separator
Console().print(Markdown(res))
```

#### Sample Output

The expected output is a list of job opportunities with detailed descriptions. Each job entry includes the company name, location, job title, responsibilities, required skills, standout perks, and an application link.
