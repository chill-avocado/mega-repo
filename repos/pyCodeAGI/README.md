# pyCodeAGI
A small AGI experiment to generate a Python app given what app the user wants to build. The project just started, so please keep an eye on the updates.

It's very early, but run the script to try out the AGI.

Of course, it uses [LangChainAI](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain). AGI concept adopted from [@yoheinakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima)'s [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi).
