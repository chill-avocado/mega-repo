# Teenage‑AGI

The **Teenage‑AGI** project is an experimental AGI framework that endows an agent with a “teenage” persona. It can be mined for reusable ideas such as:

- **Persona-driven prompt design** – uses carefully crafted system prompts to give the agent a distinct personality and communication style (e.g., teenage tone).
- **Stateful agent loop** – maintains conversation history and task state so the agent can reason about its goals, actions, and experiences over multiple steps.
- **Goal decomposition** – breaks high-level goals into subgoals and executes them sequentially while reflecting on outcomes.
- **Self-evaluation** – includes mechanisms for the agent to critique its own outputs and adjust behaviour.
- **Extensibility** – while experimental, the architecture allows integration of new tools or memory modules to expand capabilities.
