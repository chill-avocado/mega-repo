# Feature: SuperCoder

This document summarizes components from the `RKALM/SuperCoder` repository to integrate into our unified AI system.

## Source Repository
`RKALM/SuperCoder`

## Key Components to Reuse

- **Autonomous code generation** – System to iteratively write, run, and refine code based on high-level objectives.
- **Self-healing loop** – Automatically tests generated code and fixes issues via re-iteration.
- **Project scaffolding** – Creates project structures, manages dependencies, and organizes outputs.
- **Language support** – Utilizes language models and static analysis to improve generated code quality.

These concepts will inform the autonomous code synthesis layer of the unified program.
