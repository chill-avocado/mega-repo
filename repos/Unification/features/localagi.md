# LocalAGI

The **LocalAGI** project provides a self-hostable platform for running AGI agents entirely on your own hardware. Key features to reuse include:

- **Self‑hosted runtime** – runs locally without external dependencies, integrating with open‑source models via Ollama or LM Studio, ensuring privacy and offline capability.
- **Modular architecture** – separates the agent core, tools, memory and UI layers so you can swap or extend components easily.
- **API and UI** – exposes a REST API and web UI for creating, controlling and monitoring agents.
- **Tool integrations** – supports pluggable tools for web search, file system access, code execution, data retrieval and more.
- **Configuration management** – unified configuration files handle model settings, tool permissions and user authentication.
