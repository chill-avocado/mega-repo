# Feature: Automata

This document describes pieces of the `emrgnt-cmplxty/automata` repository to integrate into our unified AI system.

## Source Repository
`emrgnt-cmplxty/automata`

## Key Components to Reuse

- **Agent architecture** – Defines an autonomous agent loop with planning, execution, and reflection steps.
- **Memory and context management** – Mechanisms for storing and retrieving short-term and long-term memories.
- **Self-improvement** – Capabilities for agents to evaluate their own performance and adjust strategies.
- **Tool integration** – Pluggable tool system enabling the agent to call external APIs and functions.

These features will help shape the core agent kernel in the unified project.
