# Feature: browser-use/web-ui

This document describes the useful pieces of the `browser-use/web-ui` repository.

## Source Repository
`browser-use/web-ui`

## Key Components to Reuse

- **In-browser agent UI** – A lightweight user interface that runs directly in the browser, enabling simple deployment without a server.
- **Front-end integration** – Connects with AI agent backends to display tasks, responses, and context.
- **Local storage and session state** – Stores conversation state and user preferences client-side.
- **Responsive design** – Works across different devices and screen sizes.

We will adapt these components for a self-contained browser client that complements the main web UI, giving users a simplified interface when running the unified agent in browser-only environments.
