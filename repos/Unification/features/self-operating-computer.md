This file summarizes features from OthersideAI/self-operating-computer repository for enabling a multimodal AI agent to operate a computer autonomously. Key elements to reuse include:

- **Multimodal agent core**: Combines language models with vision and audio models (LLM + image/audio recognition) to understand the screen and issue actions accordingly. Supports tasks like reading text on screen, clicking, typing, and voice commands.
- **End-to-end computer control**: Implements low-level functions to control the mouse, keyboard, and system-level actions across platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux). Enables the agent to launch applications, navigate menus, and manage files.
- **Observation and feedback loop**: Continuously captures screenshots or video frames of the desktop, processes them with vision models to identify UI elements, and sends them back to the LLM for decision making.
- **Task planning and decomposition**: Uses an agent loop to break high-level goals into sequences of UI actions, similar to how a human operates a computer. Maintains context and memory of previous actions.
- **Plugin and tool integration**: Offers a framework to plug in additional tools (e.g., web browser, file explorer, terminal) as separate modules. Allows customizing the agent's abilities for specific workflows.
- **Safety and sandboxing**: Provides safeguards to prevent unintended system modifications, including permission prompts, rate limiting, and optional sandbox modes.
