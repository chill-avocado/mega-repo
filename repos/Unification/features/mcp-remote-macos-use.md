This file summarizes features from baryhuang/mcp-remote-macos-use repository for remote Mac control. Key elements to reuse include:

- **Remote macOS control**: Provides tools and scripts to remotely control a Mac using an AI agent. It can send commands to a remote macOS machine and receive responses, enabling headless operation.
- **Natural language interface**: Accepts natural-language requests (via an LLM) and maps them to remote Mac actions (open apps, run shell commands, search Spotlight, control playback).
- **Secure remote connection**: Uses secure channels (e.g., SSH or remote Mac API) to connect to the Mac without exposing credentials. Handles authentication and session management.
- **Scriptable command wrappers**: Wraps common macOS tasks (e.g., file management, launching applications, controlling input devices) into callable functions that agents can invoke.
- **Extensibility**: Allows adding new remote commands or workflows by composing existing functions. Supports plugin architecture for domain-specific tasks.
- **Safety and permissions**: Implements permission checks to prevent unintended remote operations and logs all actions for auditing.
