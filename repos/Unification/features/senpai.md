# Senpai

The `senpai` project is a lightweight and modular agent framework. Key features include:

- **Lightweight core** – provides a simple agent loop for planning, tool invocation, and result interpretation.
- **Modularity** – built with modular components that can be swapped or extended; each tool is a separate module with clear interfaces.
- **Task orchestration** – supports task decomposition and goal-directed behavior using LLMs.
- **Extensibility** – encourages adding custom tools and strategies with minimal boilerplate.
- **CLI and API** – offers command-line and programmatic interfaces for running agents and integrating with other systems.
