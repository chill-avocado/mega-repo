# AgentGPT

The `AgentGPT` project is a web-based platform for creating and deploying autonomous AI agents in the browser. Its key features include:

- **Interactive web UI** – allows users to configure the agent’s name, goal, and memory size from within a browser without coding.
- **Task management** – visualizes tasks and automatically generates subtasks and execution plans using LLMs.
- **LLM integration** – connects to multiple models (OpenAI, other local LLMs) for reasoning and code execution.
- **Persistent sessions** – saves agent states, conversation history, and tasks in local storage or backend for later retrieval.
- **Extensible plugins** – supports adding tools and connectors to allow agents to interact with external systems (APIs, databases, browsers).
