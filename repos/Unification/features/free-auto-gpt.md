# Free Auto GPT

The `Free-Auto-GPT` repository provides a simplified Auto-GPT implementation that does not require a paid API key. Key aspects include:

- **Free OpenAI alternative** – uses local models or free endpoints to avoid paid API usage.
- **Task automation loop** – implements the goal–decompose–act–refine loop to autonomously pursue tasks.
- **Memory system** – stores intermediate information in vector stores or plain files for context.
- **Plugin support** – can integrate with external tools and data sources via plug-ins.
- **Example configurations** – includes sample tasks and configurations to help users get started quickly.
