# Feature: open-interpreter

This document outlines the important parts of the `openinterpreter/open-interpreter` project to incorporate into our unified AI framework.

## Source Repository
`openinterpreter/open-interpreter`

## Key Components to Reuse

- **Natural language interface** – Converts plain English instructions into executable code across multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, shell, etc.).
- **Execution environment** – Runs code securely and streams results back to the user, including interactive sessions.
- **Tool and plugin system** – Provides a mechanism to extend functionality with custom commands and external tools.
- **State management and context** – Maintains session state, variables, and conversational context during code execution.

These elements will form the interpreter layer of our unified project, enabling seamless transitions between natural language commands and code execution.
