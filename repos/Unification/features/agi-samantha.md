## Key Components to Reuse

- **Stateful AGI loop** – An autonomous loop that plans, executes, reviews tasks, and evolves capabilities over time.
- **Goal decomposition** – Breaks broad objectives into manageable tasks and subtasks.
- **Self-evaluation** – Assesses performance and adjusts strategies or tools accordingly.
- **Extensible modules** – Architecture allowing new behaviors or tools to be plugged into the agent.

These elements will contribute to the advanced planning and self-improvement features of the unified system.
