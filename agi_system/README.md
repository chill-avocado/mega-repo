# AGI System

This directory contains an advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system that builds upon the integrated system and evolves it toward true general intelligence capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

The AGI system is designed with the following key principles:

1. **Cognitive Architecture**: Implements a comprehensive cognitive architecture inspired by human cognition
2. **Self-Improvement**: Capable of improving its own code, models, and capabilities
3. **Multi-Modal Understanding**: Processes and integrates information across different modalities (text, vision, audio)
4. **Meta-Learning**: Learns how to learn more efficiently over time
5. **Causal Reasoning**: Understands causality and can reason about cause and effect
6. **Abstraction Hierarchy**: Builds hierarchical abstractions from low-level to high-level concepts
7. **Embodied Cognition**: Interacts with the environment to ground understanding in real-world experience
8. **Emergent Behavior**: Designed to allow complex behaviors to emerge from simpler components

## System Components

The AGI system consists of the following major components:

### Core Cognitive Architecture

- **Executive Function**: Coordinates and manages cognitive processes
- **Working Memory**: Maintains and manipulates information in the current context
- **Long-Term Memory**: Stores knowledge, experiences, and learned patterns
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses cognitive resources on relevant information
- **Meta-Cognitive System**: Monitors and regulates cognitive processes

### Specialized Modules

- **Perception System**: Processes and interprets sensory information
- **Language Understanding**: Comprehends and generates natural language
- **Reasoning Engine**: Performs logical, causal, and analogical reasoning
- **Learning System**: Acquires new knowledge and skills
- **Planning System**: Creates and executes plans to achieve goals
- **Creativity Module**: Generates novel ideas and solutions
- **Social Intelligence**: Understands and models other agents' mental states
- **Self-Model**: Maintains a model of the system's own capabilities and state

### Integration Layer

- **Information Flow Manager**: Controls the flow of information between components
- **Cognitive Bus**: Provides a standardized interface for component communication
- **Resource Allocator**: Allocates computational resources based on priorities
- **Coherence Maintainer**: Ensures consistency across the system's knowledge and beliefs

## Key Innovations

1. **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning
2. **Hierarchical Predictive Processing**: Uses prediction errors to drive learning at multiple levels
3. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Learns from unlabeled data through self-generated supervision signals
4. **Continual Learning**: Acquires new knowledge without forgetting previous learning
5. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Driven by curiosity, novelty, and competence
6. **Causal Inference**: Discovers and reasons about causal relationships
7. **Meta-Learning**: Improves learning algorithms based on experience
8. **Abstraction Formation**: Creates useful abstractions from concrete experiences

## Usage

The AGI system can be used in various ways:

```python
from agi_system import AGISystem

# Create an AGI system
agi = AGISystem()

# Initialize the system with specific capabilities
agi.initialize(capabilities=['language', 'reasoning', 'learning'])

# Set a goal for the system
agi.set_goal("Solve a complex problem and explain the solution")

# Run the system
agi.run()

# Get the results
results = agi.get_results()
```

## Development Roadmap

The AGI system is being developed in phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Implement the core cognitive architecture and basic modules
2. **Integration Phase**: Connect modules and ensure coherent information flow
3. **Learning Phase**: Develop advanced learning capabilities
4. **Self-Improvement Phase**: Enable the system to improve its own code and models
5. **Generalization Phase**: Expand capabilities to handle diverse domains and tasks
6. **Emergence Phase**: Foster the emergence of higher-level cognitive abilities

## Current Status

The system is currently in the Foundation Phase, with the following components implemented:

- Core cognitive architecture framework
- Basic perception, language, and reasoning modules
- Simple learning mechanisms
- Initial integration layer
